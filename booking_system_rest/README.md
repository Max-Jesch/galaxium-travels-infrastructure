# Galaxium Travels Booking API

A FastAPI-based REST service for booking interplanetary flights in the Galaxium Travels system.

## Overview

This API provides endpoints for:
- User registration and management
- Flight browsing and booking
- Booking management (view, cancel)
- Flight seat availability tracking

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Set up and run local

1. Set up virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3.12 -m venv .venv
   source ./.venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Issues Addressed

### User Registration and ID Matching Problems
The system had reported issues with:
1. **User Registration Failures**: Users couldn't register properly
2. **User ID Mismatches**: User IDs were not properly matched to users during booking operations

### Root Causes Identified and Fixed
1. **Double Database Commit**: Fixed duplicate `db.commit()` calls in booking operations
2. **Missing Auto-increment**: Added proper `autoincrement=True` to primary key columns
3. **Email Validation**: Enhanced Pydantic models with proper email validation
4. **Pydantic Deprecation**: Updated from deprecated `orm_mode` to `from_attributes`

## Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework has been implemented to prevent regression of these issues:

- **100% Code Coverage** achieved
- **34 Test Cases** covering all critical functionality
- **pytest** with FastAPI TestClient for integration testing
- **In-memory SQLite** for isolated test execution

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests
python run_tests.py all

# Run tests without coverage (faster)
python run_tests.py fast

# Run specific test categories
python run_tests.py user      # User management tests
python run_tests.py booking   # Booking system tests
python run_tests.py flight    # Flight management tests
```

For detailed testing information, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## API Endpoints

### User Management
- `POST /register` - Register a new user
- `GET /user_id` - Get user by name and email

### Flight Management
- `GET /flights` - List all available flights

### Booking Management
- `POST /book` - Book a flight
- `GET /bookings/{user_id}` - Get user's bookings
- `POST /cancel/{booking_id}` - Cancel a booking


## Setup (Local)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Database

The application uses SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM. The database is automatically initialized and seeded with sample data on startup.

## Development

### Code Quality
- **100% Test Coverage** maintained
- **PEP 8** compliance
- **Type Hints** throughout

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Database Tests**: Data integrity verification
- **Edge Case Testing**: Error handling and validation

## Contributing

1. **Write Tests**: All new features must include tests
2. **Maintain Coverage**: Ensure 100% code coverage
3. **Run Tests**: Execute test suite before submitting changes
4. **Follow Patterns**: Use existing test structure and naming conventions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Locked**: Ensure no other processes are using the database
2. **Import Errors**: Check virtual environment activation
3. **Test Failures**: Review test output and fix underlying issues

### Getting Help
- Check [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for testing guidance
- Review FastAPI documentation for API development
- Examine existing test patterns in the codebase
