# Error Message Improvements for AI Agent Clarity

This document summarizes the improvements made to error messages across the Galaxium Travels infrastructure project to make them more actionable and clear for AI agents.

## Overview

The original error messages were often brief and generic (e.g., "User not found", "Flight not found"), which could leave AI agents confused about what went wrong and what steps to take next. The improved error messages now provide:

1. **Clear problem identification** - What exactly went wrong
2. **Context information** - Relevant details about the failure
3. **Actionable next steps** - Specific suggestions for resolution
4. **Alternative approaches** - Other endpoints or tools to try

## Systems Updated

### 1. Booking System REST API (`booking_system_rest/app.py`)

#### Flight Booking Errors
- **Before**: "Flight not found"
- **After**: "Flight not found. The specified flight_id does not exist in our system. Please check the flight_id or use the /flights endpoint to see available flights."

- **Before**: "No seats available"
- **After**: "No seats available on this flight. The flight is fully booked. Please check other flights or try again later if seats become available."

#### User Validation Errors
- **Before**: "User not found or name does not match user ID"
- **After**: 
  - If user exists but name doesn't match: "User ID {id} exists but the name '{provided_name}' does not match the registered name '{actual_name}'. Please verify the user's name or use the correct name for this user ID."
  - If user doesn't exist: "User with ID {id} is not registered in our system. The user might need to register first using the /register endpoint, or you may need to check if the user_id is correct."

#### Booking Management Errors
- **Before**: "Booking not found"
- **After**: "Booking with ID {id} not found. The booking may have been deleted or the booking_id may be incorrect. Please verify the booking_id or check if the booking exists."

- **Before**: "Booking already cancelled"
- **After**: "Booking {id} is already cancelled and cannot be cancelled again. The booking status is currently '{status}'. If you need to make changes, please contact support."

#### User Registration Errors
- **Before**: "Email already registered"
- **After**: "Email '{email}' is already registered. A user with this email already exists in our system. If you're trying to access an existing account, use the /user_id endpoint with the correct name and email to get the user_id."

#### User Retrieval Errors
- **Before**: "User not found"
- **After**: "User not found with name '{name}' and email '{email}'. The user may not be registered in our system. Please check the spelling of both name and email, or register the user first using the /register endpoint."

### 2. Booking System MCP Server (`booking_system_mcp/mcp_server.py`)

Similar improvements were made to the MCP server tools, with error messages adapted for the MCP context:

- **Flight booking errors** now suggest using the `list_flights` tool
- **User validation errors** suggest using the `register_user` tool
- **User retrieval errors** suggest using the `register_user` tool
- **Booking management errors** provide clear context about what went wrong

### 3. HR Database System (`HR_database/app.py`)

#### Database Operation Errors
- **Before**: "Error reading database: {error}"
- **After**: "Error reading employee database: {error}. The database file may be corrupted or missing. Please check if the data/employees.md file exists and has the correct format."

- **Before**: "Error writing to database: {error}"
- **After**: "Error writing to employee database: {error}. The system may not have write permissions to the data directory, or the data/employees.md file may be locked by another process."

#### Employee Operation Errors
- **Before**: "Employee not found"
- **After**: "Employee with ID {id} not found. The employee may have been deleted or the employee_id may be incorrect. Please verify the employee_id or use the /employees endpoint to see all available employees."

## Benefits for AI Agents

1. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear identification of what went wrong
2. **Faster Resolution**: Specific suggestions for next steps
3. **Better Context**: Understanding of the current system state
4. **Alternative Paths**: Knowledge of other endpoints/tools to try
5. **Self-Service**: Agents can often resolve issues without human intervention

## Testing Updates

All test files have been updated to verify the new error message content:
- `test_booking_system.py` - Updated assertions for booking-related errors
- `test_user_management.py` - Updated assertions for user-related errors
- Tests now verify both the error status codes and the specific content of error messages

## Implementation Notes

- Error messages are now more verbose but provide actionable information
- Messages include specific endpoint suggestions where applicable
- Context is provided about what might have caused the error
- Alternative approaches are suggested when possible
- Messages are consistent across REST API and MCP server implementations

## Future Considerations

1. **Internationalization**: Consider multi-language support for error messages
2. **Error Codes**: Add structured error codes for programmatic handling
3. **Logging**: Ensure detailed error messages are properly logged
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect new error message format
5. **Monitoring**: Track which error messages are most common to identify UX improvements
